# Express.js Stripe API Integration

This is a simple Express.js application demonstrating how to integrate the Stripe API for handling payments.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JWT tokens.
- **Payment Handling**: Integration with the Stripe API for processing payments.
- **CRUD Operations**: Basic CRUD operations for managing products and orders.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MySQL or another relational database

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mandeepsng/stripe-yt.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd express-stripe-api
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=password
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   ```

   Replace `your_stripe_secret_key` with your actual Stripe secret key and `your_database_name` with your MySQL database name.

4. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
